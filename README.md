# Blue_GPT_Python
A repo for a small pet project, Blue, a python-based wrapper for the openai API for my personal use (and yours) on Windows. This project aims to have Blue be a helpful command-line assistant. I eventually want to extend this to finely-tuned models that are really good at answering domain-related knowledge.
